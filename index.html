					Steven Paul Jobs was an American business magnate, inventor, and
					investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the
					chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt
					Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of
					Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He was a pioneer of
					the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with
					his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

					Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American
					mother. He was adopted shortly after his birth. Jobs attended Reed
					College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he
					traveled through India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen
					Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's
					Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a
					year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first
					highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the
					commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven
					and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development
					of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough
					Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The
					Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the
					addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature
					vector graphics.

					In 1985, Jobs was forced out of Apple after a long power struggle with
					the company's board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year,
					Jobs took a few Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer
					platform development company that specialized in computers for
					higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to
					develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer
					graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company
					was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer-animated feature film
					Toy Story (1995) and went on to become a major animation studio,
					producing over 25 films since.

					In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's acquisition
					of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on
					the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer Jony
					Ive to develop a line of products that had larger cultural
					ramifications, beginning with the "Think different" advertising
					campaign and leading to the Apple Store, App Store (iOS), iMac, iPad,
					iPod, iPhone, iTunes, and iTunes Store. In 2001, the original Mac OS
					was replaced with the completely new Mac OS X (later known as macOS),
					based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the operating system a
					modern Unix-based foundation for the first time. In 2003, Jobs was
					diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. He died of
					respiratory arrest related to the tumor in 2011, at the age of 56,
					with Tim Cook succeeding him as CEO of Apple. In 2022, he was
					posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
